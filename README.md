# Tetris-Recreation
A self-directed project recreating Tetris by self-learning OOP and PyGame in under a month

The goal of this game is to garner as many points as possible by generating as many shapes before "Gameover". Each time a new shape is generated, the score increases by 1 point.

The user can interact with the game using the left and right arrows. (To move the block one unit left, hit left. To move the block one unit right, hit right.) For the purposes of this game, there is no rotation of the blocks nor checking of complete rows. These are features that I hope to implement in the next version of this game.
